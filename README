1. Overview
===========

Lambdoc is a library providing support for semantically rich documents in
Ocsigen web applications.  It includes parsers for three different markup
languages: Lambtex, Lambhtml, and Lamblite.  The first is inspired by LaTeX,
the second is inspired by HTML, and the last is a lightweight markup language
in the spirit of Markdown and Wiki Creole.  The library also includes the
possibility of outputing any Lambdoc document as an Ocsigen XHTML.M value.


2. Dependencies
===============

Lambdoc requires Ocsigen [1], Ulex [2], Menhir [3], ExtLib [4], Sexplib [5],
Pcre-ocaml [6], PXP [7], Lwt [8], Blahcaml [9], and Camlhighlight [10].


3. Building and installing
==========================

Go to the 'src' directory and run 'make'.  To perform a Findlib installation
issue 'make install' or 'make reinstall'.  To remove the package issue
'make uninstall'.  The API documentation can be built with 'make apidoc'.


4. License
==========

Lambdoc is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2.
See LICENSE file for full license text.


5. Notes on the provided CSS
============================

Inside the 'css' directory you will find the sample CSS adapted to the XHTML
output generated by the Lambdoc_write_xhtml module.  It is fairly simple yet
pleasant looking, and a good starting point if you want to customise it for
your own sites.

You will note that most elements are given their own class name, prefixed by
the identifier 'doc'.  Inline bold elements, for example, are identified by
the class 'doc_bold'.  This solution was preferred over the alternative of
referrencing '.doc b' because it does not require the usage of descendant
selectors, which have terrible performance in current browsers.  The chosen
solution does have the disadvantage of producing larger markup, however.
