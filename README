1. Overview
===========

Lambdoc is a library providing support for semantically rich documents
in web applications, built with Ocsigen/Eliom [1] integration in mind.
It includes parsers for three different markup languages: Lambtex, Lambxml,
and Lambwiki.  The first is inspired by LaTeX, the second is an XML-based
markup based on HTML, and the last is a lightweight markup language in the
spirit of Markdown and Wiki Creole.  The library also includes the possibility
of outputing any Lambdoc document as an Ocsigen HTML5 value.

Additional capabilities include the runtime customisation of available document
features (you may, for example, declare that a certain class of users is
only allowed to produce documents containing nothing more than paragraphs of
plain text), detailed error messages, and the definition of basic macros.
It also ships with 'lambcmd', a CLI application that allows the conversion
between any of the input formats into one of the supported output targets.


2. Dependencies
===============

Lambdoc requires Ocsigen [1], Ulex [2], Menhir [3], Batteries [4], Sexplib
[5], Pcre-ocaml [6], PXP [7], Lwt [8], Blahcaml [9], and Camlhighlight [10].
The command line utility 'lambcmd' and some of the demos also depend on Bookaml
[11].  Note that this dependency does not apply to the core Lambdoc library.


3. Building and installing
==========================

To build only the library run 'make lib'.  To perform a Findlib installation
of the library run 'make install' or 'make reinstall'.  To remove the package
run 'make uninstall'.  The API documentation can be built with 'make doc'.

If you also wish to build the lambcmd command line utility, issue 'make
lambcmd'.  Note that this binary also requires the Bookaml [11] package.
Finally, if you wish to build everything (library + lambcmd) you may simply
run 'make all' or just 'make'.


4. License
==========

Lambdoc is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2.
See LICENSE file for full license text.


5. Notes on the provided CSS
============================

Inside the 'css' directory you will find the sample CSS adapted to the HTML5
output generated by the Lambdoc_write_html5 module.  It is fairly simple yet
pleasant looking, and a good starting point if you want to customise it for
your own sites.

You will note that most elements are given their own class name, prefixed
by the identifier 'doc'.  Inline bold elements, for example, are identified
by the class 'doc_bold'.  This solution was preferred over the alternative
of referrencing '.doc b' because it has much better performance.  It does
have the disadvantage of producing larger markup, however.
